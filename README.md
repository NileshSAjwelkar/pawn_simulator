The Pawn Simulator.

The code accepts the inputs as arguments in the script file (pawn_simulator.rb) itself.


The script is called from within the file itself. The inputs should be in an array format.

For eg. ["PLACE 2 3 N White", "MOVE", "LEFT", "MOVE", "RIGHT", "MOVE", "REPORT"]

The inputs are not case sensitive.
